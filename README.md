# Arduino-Encryption
Series of Encryptions from scratch done on Arduino
<br>
School mini-project with simple encryption algorithms generated in Arduino using 0 external libraries: All was done from scratch. The main algorithm is however the Custom Cipher, named Noisy Cipher because it uses the noise coming from Arduino's built in timer/interrupts.
